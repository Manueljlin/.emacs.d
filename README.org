- Package management using elpaca and use-package.
- LSP support via eglot + lsp-booster + eglot-booster.
- Meow for modal editing, optimized for Canary Ortho
- Ripped the automatic indentation config from Doom Emacs right off, to match VSCode. First checks for .editorconfig, else try to guess with dtrt-indent, else fall back to the default.
- Corfu and YASnippet for completion at point.
- Both UI and UX enhancements with Vertico, Orderless, Marginalia, helpful and Doom themes.
# - PDF support with pdf-tools.
# - macOS specific: make Emacs see the programs in $PATH with exec-path.
# (I don't really use macOS anymore, so I can't be bothered to check lol)
- Sony PSX development (with Psy-Q) ""integration"".


* Installing
** Linux (openSUSE)
We're going to be building Emacs from Git:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  # dependencies
  # note: enable source repository
  sudo zypper source-install --build-deps-only emacs
  sudo zypper in tree-sitter tree-sitter-devel

  # See https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git
  # and https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/emacs for branches
  git clone --depth 1 --branch emacs-29 https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/emacs.git

  # cd to the repo folder and run:
  autogen.sh

  # uninstall clang temporarily to avoid issues with configure
  # since it only expects you to have either gcc or clang but not
  # both lol
  sudo zypper rm clang

  # note: run ./configure --help to see available options
  ./configure --with-native-compilation --with-rsvg --with-imagemagick \
  --with-json --with-tree-sitter \
  --with-pgtk --with-x-toolkit=gtk3 --with-x \
  CFLAGS="-O2 -mtune=native -march=native -fPIC"
  # -------^ that's the letter O, not zero.

  # compile, specifying number of cores
  make -j12

  # install to /usr/local/bin/emacs
  sudo make install

  # clean repo
  git clean -fdX
#+END_SRC


** macOS
We're going to be using emacs-plus from https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus#emacs-29

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  # Install jq (dependency of emacs-plus)
  brew install jq

  # Install tree-sitter so Emacs builds with tree-sitter support via native `treesit'
  brew install tree-sitter
  # Check for treesit support by evaluating the following: `(treesit-available-p)'

  # Add repo
  brew tap d12frosted/emacs-plus

  # Install Emacs
  brew install emacs-plus@29 --with-no-frame-refocus --with-imagemagick --with-native-comp

  # Link application to the Applications folder
  ln -s /opt/homebrew/opt/emacs-plus@29/Emacs.app /Applications

  # Clone this repository
  git clone git@gitlab.com:manueljlin/emacs-config.git ~/.emacs.d     # With SSH
  git clone https://gitlab.com/manueljlin/emacs-config.git ~/.emacs.d # With HTTPS
#+END_SRC
